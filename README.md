# blog page
this is to deepen my understanding of django
hopefully a fresh start will help me improve

The plan:
* display a home page, a login/registration page, and a timeline page
* store user information in a database ideally using aws but not a must
* Do some front-end programming in order to become ready for september 
* Website should have a jade green theme
* use many of django's built-in features to learn more about them
* if I can combine my aws knowledge with this page it would be great
