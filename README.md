# blog page
this is to deepen my understanding of django
hopefully a fresh start will help me improve

The plan:
* display a home page, a login/registration page, and a timeline page #Complete
* store user information in a database ideally using aws but not a must
* Do some front-end programming in order to become ready for september 
* Website should have a jade green theme
* use many of django's built-in features to learn more about them
* if I can combine my aws knowledge with this page it would be great

#   Completed steps:
* make it more professional aesthetically -> add a jade green theme
* created a timeline page
* users can post video's with a title 

# CURRENT ISSUES:
USERS NOT BEING SAVED ON RESTART-> IT AUTO-LOGS IN SO THIS MIGHT BE AFFECTING THE ISSUE.
CANNOT DISPLAY PICTURES ON THE TIMELINE

# Next steps:
* 1 allow people to post pictures and videos
* 2 create different types of users
* 3 allow users to join groups 
* 4 create a timeline that can sort posts by different features


# Types of users:
* admin for django
* moderators for different circles
* content creators for different circles
* normal user -> Need to pick a better name for them
